-> Electron is a framework for creating desktop apps while using familiar web technology tools.
-> Websites or web apps running in your browsers can't access a lot of lower level features of your OS like hard drive.

--> Electron works indentical to how Google Chrome works. Google chorome renders each tab separately and each tab which is
rendered is called Child Process or Renderer Process. Tabs don't directly talk with overall Chrome app. They talk to each other
through Inter Process Communication (IPC).

## UNder the hood, ELectron makes use of the chromium open source project which is exact same codebase that the Google Chrome
browser is based upon. We are going to create an object or a process that spawns one Main Window and that is going to have
some number of Child Rendered Process. The purpose of each of these renderer process in our Elecrton app is to show a separate
window to use or in a sort of desktop looking environment. These children talk by the same IPC.
